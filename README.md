Hi, I’m @SvenMein!
I’m a PhD student at Fischer von Mollard’s lab at Bielefeld University.
Currently I am trying to elucidate the roles of pseudokinases in the intracellular trafficking machinery using baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model organism.
This has me spending a lot of time at our confocal fluorescence microscope, so here some macros I wrote for ImageJ to speed up the analysis.
These macros won’t be the most elegant ones, but they get the job done.
